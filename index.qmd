# WEEK 1 - LITERATURE REVIEW

## Machine Learning for Analyzing Real-World Data in Disease Prediction and Management

### BACKGROUND / MOTIVATION :

The integration of machine learning (ML) with real-world data (RWD) has
emerged as one of the most transformative developments in modern
healthcare. Traditional clinical trials, while regarded as the gold
standard for evaluating interventions, are inherently limited by their
controlled settings, strict eligibility criteria, and relatively small
sample sizes. In contrast, RWD—derived from electronic health records
(EHRs), patient registries, claims data, and increasingly wearable
health devices—captures patient experiences in routine care. This makes
it more representative of diverse populations and thus more relevant for
informing clinical practice. The reviewed article situates itself in
this context, recognizing that the healthcare industry is experiencing
an urgent demand for predictive and personalized solutions driven by the
exponential growth of healthcare data.

. The central problem identified in the paper lies in the gap between
the availability of massive, heterogeneous health datasets and the
effective use of these datasets for disease prediction and management.
While ML algorithms have shown potential in controlled research
contexts, their application to messy, incomplete, and unstandardized RWD
remains underexplored. Moreover, the integration of ML into real-world
clinical workflows is hindered by challenges such as poor data quality,
lack of model interpretability, limited generalizability, and ethical
concerns regarding privacy and bias.

. This systematic review attempts to address this gap by synthesizing
evidence from recent clinical trials and cohort studies (2014–2024) that
applied ML to RWD. In doing so, it seeks to identify both the progress
and persistent obstacles in this evolving field. The significance of the
research question is multifold. First, the global burden of chronic
diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer demands
more effective predictive tools to enable earlier diagnosis and
intervention. ML applied to RWD can potentially stratify patients by
risk, tailor treatments to individuals, and improve overall health
outcomes. Second, healthcare systems worldwide are under increasing
strain from rising costs and aging populations. Efficient predictive
modeling can reduce unnecessary interventions, optimize resource
allocation, and improve cost-effectiveness. Finally, regulators such as
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines
Agency (EMA) are beginning to formally recognize the role of real-world
evidence (RWE) in evaluating therapies. This raises the stakes for
ensuring that ML-driven insights derived from RWD are robust,
interpretable, and ethically sound.

In sum, the paper positions itself at the intersection of urgent
healthcare challenges and technological opportunity. By systematically
reviewing the landscape of ML applications to RWD, the authors aim not
only to catalog methodological advances but also to spotlight critical
barriers—particularly data quality, fairness, and regulatory
frameworks—that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of ML in
precision medicine and healthcare management.

### METHODS USED

The review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, ensuring methodological rigor and
transparency. The authors applied clear inclusion and exclusion criteria
to focus on clinical trials and cohort studies that employed ML
techniques on real-world health data for disease prediction or
management.

Importantly, the scope was deliberately limited to peer-reviewed studies
in English published between 2014 and 2024, reflecting the most recent
advances in both ML and healthcare analytics. The information sources
included major biomedical and clinical databases such as PubMed, Scopus,
Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. To capture gray literature,
Google Scholar was also searched, and manual reference checks were
performed. This multi-source approach increased the comprehensiveness of
the review. The search strategy was carefully constructed with Boolean
operators and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), combining terms related
to ML (“machine learning,” “deep learning,” “artificial intelligence”),
clinical study designs (“randomized controlled trial,” “pragmatic
trial,” “cohort study”), and healthcare outcomes (“disease prediction,”
“management,” “outcomes”).

**Logistic regression**: $$
P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_p x_p)}}
$$

$$
\hat{y} = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } P(y=1|x) \geq 0.5 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$ **Support Vector Machine**: $$
f(x) = \text{sign}(w^T x + b)
$$

$$
\min_{w, b} \; \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad y_i (w^T x_i + b) \geq 1 \; \forall i
$$

$$
\min_{w, b, \xi} \; \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 + C \sum_i \xi_i
$$

The study selection process was conducted in two stages: initial title
and abstract screening, followed by full-text review by independent
reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and, when
necessary, a third reviewer. This rigorous screening reduced the initial
pool of over 11,000 records to 57 eligible studies. Data extraction was
standardized and included study design, disease category, type of RWD,
ML methodology, performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity, AUROC), and reported challenges.

The methodological contribution of this review lies in its systematic
comparison of diverse ML algorithms across multiple disease domains.
Algorithms analyzed included random forest (42% of studies), logistic
regression (37%), support vector machines (32%), XGBoost (21%),
artificial neural networks (19%), and decision trees (16%), among
others. The review also documented novel techniques, such as deep neural
networks and natural language processing (NLP) applied to unstructured
EHR text, which represent cutting-edge approaches in the field.
Furthermore, the categorization of studies by disease type
(cardiovascular, cancer, neurological, infectious, etc.) and by RWE
source (EHRs, patient registries, wearable devices) provided a
structured framework to assess methodological breadth.

| Diseases                  | Studies, n (%) |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Cardiovascular diseases   | 19 (33)        |
| Cancers and tumors        | 9 (16)         |
| Neurological diseases     | 6 (11)         |
| Infectious diseases       | 5 (9)          |
| Metabolic diseases        | 5 (9)          |
| Spinal diseases           | 3 (5)          |
| Gastrointestinal diseases | 2 (4)          |
| Ocular diseases           | 2 (4)          |
| Respiratory diseases      | 2 (4)          |
| Other diseases            | 4 (7)          |

Overall, the methods employed are well suited to the research question.
By restricting the scope to clinical trials and cohort studies using
RWD, the review highlights real-world applicability rather than
hypothetical or simulation-based models. The PRISMA framework enhances
replicability, while the inclusion of performance metrics allows for
comparative evaluation of ML approaches. The innovative integration of
gray literature and regulatory documents further strengthens the
analysis, positioning this review as a comprehensive map of the current
landscape of ML in real-world healthcare.

### SIGNIFICANCE OF THE WORK

The findings of the review underscore the substantial but uneven
progress of ML in real-world disease prediction and management. The
synthesis of 57 studies reveals several key contributions. First, ML
methods—particularly ensemble approaches like random forest and gradient
boosting—demonstrated strong predictive performance across diverse
disease areas. For example, random forest models achieved an AUROC of
0.85 in cardiovascular disease prediction, while support vector machines
reached 83% accuracy in cancer prognosis.

Such results highlight the potential of ML to outperform or at least
complement traditional statistical models in clinical decision-making.
Second, the review provides valuable insights into the distribution of
applications. Cardiovascular diseases dominated the field (33% of
studies), followed by cancer (16%) and neurological conditions (11%).
This distribution reflects the urgent clinical need for predictive tools
in high-burden diseases. Importantly, the review also shows that EHRs
are the most common source of RWD (68%), with patient registries (26%)
and wearable devices (7%) contributing less but offering novel
opportunities for continuous and real-time monitoring.

Third, the review identifies four major application areas: disease
prediction (35% of studies), clinical decision-making (25%), healthcare
outcomes such as quality of life (23%), and survival prediction (19%).
This taxonomy illustrates that ML is not only being used for diagnosis
but also for optimizing treatment strategies, monitoring patient
well-being, and forecasting long-term outcomes—critical dimensions for
precision medicine.

The broader significance lies in the recognition of persistent
challenges. Approximately 60% of reviewed studies struggled with data
quality issues, lack of interpretability, and limited generalizability
across diverse patient populations. These limitations are particularly
problematic given the ethical stakes of deploying ML in healthcare. The
paper highlights emerging solutions such as fairness-aware algorithms,
interpretability frameworks like SHAP and LIME, and evolving regulatory
guidelines from the FDA and EMA. Yet, it makes clear that more progress
is needed to achieve equitable and transparent ML applications.

In the context of the broader field, this work contributes by
synthesizing a fragmented body of literature into a coherent overview.
Unlike prior reviews that focused narrowly on EHRs or specific diseases,
this study spans multiple conditions, data sources, and algorithm types.
It also distinguishes itself by emphasizing regulatory and ethical
frameworks, an increasingly critical dimension of digital health
research. By identifying both the promise and pitfalls of current
practices, the review provides a roadmap for future research and policy
development. In conclusion, the significance of this work lies not only
in cataloging ML applications but also in clarifying the path forward.
By bridging technical, clinical, and regulatory perspectives, the review
underscores that the future of ML in healthcare will depend on
addressing transparency, fairness, and generalizability while harnessing
the predictive power of advanced algorithms. This synthesis is therefore
highly valuable for clinicians, data scientists, and policymakers alike.
